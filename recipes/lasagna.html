  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich fillings like meat ragù, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and melted cheeses such as mozzarella and Parmesan. It's baked until bubbling and golden, then sliced into hearty portions. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region, lasagna has countless regional and international variations—from veggie-packed versions to indulgent meatball-filled Neapolitan styles.
