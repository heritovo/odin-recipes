  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Orecchiette is a type of pasta that originates from the Apulia region in southern Italy. The name "orecchiette" means "little ears" in Italian, which aptly describes the pasta's distinctive shape resembling small, concave discs. This unique form allows orecchiette to hold sauces well, making it a popular choice for hearty and flavorful dishes. Orecchiette is traditionally made from durum wheat semolina and water, resulting in a firm texture that pairs wonderfully with a variety of sauces, from simple tomato-based sauces to rich meat ragùs. It is often served with vegetables like broccoli rabe or sausage, showcasing its versatility in Italian cuisine.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>12 oz orecchiette pasta</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    <li>4 cups fresh spinach</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add halved cherry tomatoes to the skillet and cook until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the orecchiette pasta to the skillet, stirring to combine with the tomatoes and garlic.</li>
    <li>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, ensuring the pasta is mostly submerged. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Cover and cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is al dente and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Add fresh spinach to the skillet, stirring until wilted.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and stir in grated Parmesan cheese and chopped basil. Season with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if desired.</li>
